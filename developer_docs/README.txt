This folder contains documentation related to coding design and style.

If your considering submitting patches or helping in development please become
familiar with documents in this folder. In particular all python scripts are to
adhere to the PEP 8 coding style and all C code to PEP 7. Also you will find
the ribmosaic_internals document important as it outlines the file and class
structure of this project. The slmeta document outlines the slmeta XML format
used by K3D that RIB Mosaic reads for generating shader panels.

If looking for help with installation see README.txt in the "render_ribmosaic"
folder. If looking for Add-On or pipeline developer help see the manual on the
projects wiki <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ribmosaic/>.
